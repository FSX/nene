Nene is a simple IRC-bot. It's just a project for fun to improve my knowledge
of Python. I'm using Phenny as a reference and I'm also using some code from
Phenny. And I'll probably also port some plugins. Therefore this project is
licensed under the Eiffel Forum License 2. That's the same license Phenny's
using.

To do list:

 - Let asyncore work with kqueue.
 - Accept commands from STDIN.
 - Launch events when the bot connects and sends messages (pre-connect,
   post-connect and send-*).
 - Write more plugins.
