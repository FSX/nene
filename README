Nene is a simple IRC-bot. It's just a project for fun to improve my knowledge
of Python. I'm using Phenny as a reference and I'm also using some code from
Phenny. And I'll probably also port some plugins. Therefore this project is
licensed under the Eiffel Forum License 2. That's the same license Phenny's
using.

The kqueue_poller in asyncoremod is from the patch at http://bugs.python.org/issue6692
and has not been tested by me since I don't have *BSD. I'll test it later when
I installed a BSD OS.

To do list:

 - Accept commands from STDIN.
 - Launch events when the bot connects and sends messages (pre-connect,
   post-connect and send-*).
 - Write more plugins.
